TileCutter 0.4x is a complete re-write from scratch, lots has changed on the surface but most of the changes aren't immediately visible...

DOne for 0.4b:
ADD: Front/BackImage support
ADD: Summer/Winter images support
CHANGE: Dat editor and other dialogs now non-modal (i.e. you can have them open in the backgound) It is also now possible to open these things inside the main application in a side-window
ADD: Reset mask button
ADD: Load same image for all views button (so that if all views of a building are in the same image, you only have to load it once)
CHANGE: Interface improved, with radio buttons for image switching
ADD: Support for multiple open projects at once
CHANGE: Internal data structures simplified and improved
ADD: Online help available on official website, tilecutter.simutrans.com!
ADD: New project file format (which should be forwards compatible)
ADD: Cutting mask can now be hidden
ADD: Cutting mask can now have -ve values


To add in 0.4b:
ADD: Cutting output "compact" mode, which tries to save space in the output image
ADD: Cutting output can cope with front/back images, summer/snow images, 1-4 directions and multiple animation frames

ADD: Smoke editor - allows a smoke object to be produced for your factory with a live preview in the editor to help with alignment
(Most common in-game smoke files included)

ADD: Cursor/icon editor

ADD: Better "auto" function which detects "empty" space and doesn't include that in the cutting mask
