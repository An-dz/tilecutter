This version brings some new features and fixes a couple of bugs I noticed while working on them. Hopefully now the translation system ought to work fairly well (new format for the translation files though, template is attached). The plan is to use SimuTranslator for the translation. This also brings updates pertaining to climates (winter buildings will be in the next release hopefully). There will likely be one more 0.3x series release to finalise translation, add makeobj integration and add winter building support, then I'm going to work on re-coding much of it so I can add all the cool features I want to... That may well take a while, so if you have found any bugs that aren't fixed please tell me so I can fix them before the re-code :_thumbsup:
